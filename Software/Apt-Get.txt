#Adding Repositories to your Source.List File

    Repositories = servers that hold the software for particular distributions on Linux
    Repositories where the system search for software are in the source.list, and you can alter this file to define from which repositories you want to download software
    
    Adding new repositories (so the system will fist look at the default and then in newly added one) to the source.list
    1. open a file:     -->     <text_editor> /etc/apt/sources.list
    2. add repository source

    # ! Requires ROOT permission
    # Many Linux distributions divide repositories into seperate categories. For instince, Ubuntu breaks out its repository categories as follows:
        main            :   contains supported open source software
        universe        :   contains community-maintained open source software
        multiuniverse   :   contains software restricted by copyright ot other legal issues
        restricted      :   contains proprietary device drivers
        backports       :   contains packages from later releases

    # !!! Testing, Experimental or Unstable repositories might break your system, because it's not fully tested!
