/home   ---> The user's home directory
/mnt    ---> Where other filesystems are attached or mounted to the filesystem
/media  ---> Where CDs and USB devices are usually attached or mounted to the filesystem
/bin    ---> Where application binaries (the equivalent or executables in Microsoft Windows) ride
/lib    ---> Where you'll find libraries (shared programs that are similar to Windows DLLs)

Passwords are stored in /etc/shadow
