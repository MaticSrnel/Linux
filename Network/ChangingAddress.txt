#Changing IP address

    Reassigning IP of an interface
    --> ifconfig <interface> <IPAddress>


#Changing NetMask Address and Broadcast Address

    To change Network mask and broadcast address of an interface
    --> ifconfig <interface> <IP1> <netmask> <IP2> <broadcast> <IP3>


#Change MAC Address (or HWaddr)

    1.  Take down the interface     :       >>> ifconfig <interface> down
    2.  Change Mac address          :       >>> ifconfig <interface> hw ether <NewMAC>  ;   'hw': hardware, 'ether': ethernet
    3.  Bring the interface back up :       >>> ifconfig <interface> up


#Assigning new IP Address from the DHCP Server

    DHCP:   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server that runs a daemon; a process that assigns IP addresses to all the systems on the subnet and keeps log files of which IP address is allocated to which machine at any one time
    --> to connect to the internet from LAN you must have a DHCP-assigned IP.

    1.  Request New IP Address from DHCP:
        --> dhclient <interface>    
        #It sends DHCPOFFER from the DHCP Server and confirms the IP assignment to the DHCP server with a dhcp request


#Manipulating the Domain Name System

    Used to translate domain names to IP Addresses
    It is the service that translates a domain name like hackers-arise.com to the appropriate ip address

dig:

    offers a way to gather DNS information abouth a target domain
    --> dig <doman_name> <option>

    *dig hackers-arise.com ns   :   'ns' - short for nameserver
        #The answer will be stored in ANSWER SECTION
    *dig hackers-arise.com mx   :   'mx' - short for mail exchange server
        #The answer will be stored in AUTHORITY SECTION
    
    The most common Linux DNS server is Brekely Interned Name Domain (BIND) --> somtimes Kali users will refer to DNS as BIND


#Changing DNS Server

text_editor /etc/resolv.conf:

    opening /etc/resolv.conf with text editor (f.e. Leafpad)
    --> leafpad /etc/resolv.conf

    # 'nameserver <IP>'     :       IP of the nameserver

    To specify nameserver: add a line in the file: 'nameserver <IP>'
    fe--> nameserver 8.8.8.8


#Mapping Your Own IP Address

text_editor /etc/hosts:

    Hosts file performs domain name - IP Address Translation
    Can be used to specify your own IP address - domain name mapping = you can determine which IP address your browser goes to when you enter www.url.com into the browser, rather than let DNS server decide

    opening /etc/hosts with text editor (f.e. Leafpad)
    --> leafpad /etc/hosts

    # '127.0.0.1'       :       mapping for your localhost
    # '127.0.1.1'       :       your system hostname

    To add any IP address mapped to any domain you'd like: add a line to a file: '<IP> <URL>'
    f.e. --> 129.168.181.131 bankofamerica.com
    # ! Press TAB and not the SpaceBar between IP address and the domain key
